# pepcoding_hackathon
I have made a project for a #hackathon organised by #pepcoding with using only HTML/CSS, #javascript and #puppeteer.

My project can be divided in 2 parts :-

1.) A color guessing game in which a player is given a rgb color code and based on that player has to identify the correct color out of the six color options. Player has only 3 lifes so he has to guess the correct color in 3 attempts for a win otherwise he lose.

2.) In the Second part I made a Js script in which I am using puppeteer to automate winning in the game. By using puppeteer I am able to guess the correcct color without losing any life.
So, we always wins!
